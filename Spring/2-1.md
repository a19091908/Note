<h3>2-1 Spring IOC</h3>
* IOC Inversion of Control
	Objects are controled by Spring container instead of programmers.
* The advantages of IOC
	1. Losse coupling
	2. Lifecycle management
	3. More testable

<h3>2-2 Spring IOC and Bean</h3>
* Bean
	We call a object as a Bean if the object is created by Spring container.
* @Component
	* Target: Class
	* Usage: Spring container will generate a object of the class marked as Component

<h3>2-3 Autowire Bean</h3>
* @Autowired
	* Target: a variable of a class
	* Usage: inject a bean into a variable whose class type is matched to bean type

* @Qualifier
	* Target: a variable of a class, always used with @Autowired
	* Usage: indicate the bean name which you want to inject into the autowired variable.

<h3>2-4 The creation of the bean</h3>
* The liftcycle of the bean in spring boot
	1. Start Spring Boot
	2. Check the annontation above the class
		1. @Component
		2. @Configuration
		3. None
	3. Start Successfully

* @Configuration
	* Target: Class
	* Usage: The class having this annotation is for setting up Spring

* @Bean
	* Target: Method in the class having @Configuration
	* Usage: create a bean by this method in Spring Container

<h3>2-5 initialize bean</h3>
* Two methods to create a bean
	1. Add @Component above the class
	2. Add @Configuration and @Bean on the class and the method

* Initialize a bean
	1. Add @PostConstruct above a method 
	2. Implement InitializingBean interface and overide afterPropertiesSet() 

<h3>2-7 read the configuration of Spring Boot</h3>
* @Value
	* Target: set the variables of Bean or the class which setting up the spring
	* Usage: read the value in the application.properties

<pre>
<code>
	@Component
	public class MyBean{
		// put the value of my.name in the application.properties to the variable name. 
		// If my.name does not exist in the application.properties, set the default value Justin to the variable name. 
		@Value("${my.name:Justin}")
		private String name;
	}
</code>
</pre>
