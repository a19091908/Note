<h3>2-1 Spring IOC</h3>
* IOC Inversion of Control
	Objects are controled by Spring container instead of programmers.
* The advantages of IOC
	1. Losse coupling
	2. Lifecycle management
	3. More testable

<h3>2-2 Spring IOC and Bean</h3>
* Bean
	We call a object as a Bean if the object is created by Spring container.
* @Component
	* Target: Class
	* Usage: Spring container will generate a object of the class marked as Component

<h3>2-3 Autowire Bean</h3>
* @Autowired
	* Target: a variable of a class
	* Usage: inject a bean into a variable whose class type is matched to bean type

* @Qualifier
	* Target: a variable of a class, always used with @Autowired
	* Usage: indicate the bean name which you want to inject into the autowired variable.
